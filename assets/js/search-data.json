            "content": "What’s the Craze all About?! . Space, the final frontier! The ultimate playground for human curiosity and ingenuity. USA and Russia have etched their names in this quest of helping mankind reach space, and all the credit goes to their amazingly redundant and ingenious space flight programmes.These two countries are the 2 out of the only 3 nations that have successfully launched manned missions into space. We have the “Cold War ‘’ to thank for, for it was the reason why these two countries were able to achieve what they did. A period of great rivalry between them, this also extended to space missions, leading to what is now known as the “Space Race”. . . Hi, there from space!, 1 | . India joins the race! . The Space Race was an integral part of the Cold War, which was ended by the USA after launching its legendary Apollo missions. India is all set to become the 4th nation with its very own manned space mission, Gaganyaan. . Prime minister Narendra Modi announced it from atop the Red Fort in 2018 on our Independence day. A perfect day to announce the mission which, if successful, would make India truly independent and a dominant force in the global space community. This project is planned to take place in broadly 3 stages, 2 unmanned and 1 manned. A 3 person crew in a low Earth orbit by indeginous GSLV Mk-III. . . Comparison of different launchers, 2 | . . GSLV Mk-3, 3 | . GSLV MK-III?? sounds like a new Iron Man suit!!! . GSLV MK_III, weighing a massive 55 tons,built initially to launch communication satellites into geostationary orbit, went on to become the very launcher to be used for Chandrayan - 2, ISRO’s heaviest spacecraft. Certain upgrades are planned for increasing its efficiency. The geometry of the propellant inside the rocket constitutes a very important part of its performance. When the fuel burns, its shape changes, and this is truly remarkable.. Recently the propellant grain geometry of the head end segment was changed from a 10 star slotted lobbed configuration to 13 starred configuration. . The planned changes include replacing the original L110 core stage, powered by twin engine configuration, with kerolox. Kerolox is a binary rocket fuel composed of liquid oxygen and kerosene.The fuel volume judges the capabilities of the rocket . After various research work and carefully testing various fuels to optimise thrust- weight (of fuel) ratio, kerolox has proved to be much better propollent than the traditionally used hydrolox. . It will be powered by an indegenous liquid fuel rocket engine, SCE-200, which is still in development. This engine is also expected to power up the upcoming ISRO projects: Unified Launch Vehicle and Reusable Launch Vehicle. . . an image of the SCE-200!, 4 | . This will increase its payload to 6 metric tonnes (A huge difference!). An increase in the propellant load on hydrolox stage and a new cryogenic tank (a tank used to store liquid at very low temperatures), C32-LH2, made by Hindustan Aeronautics Limited are amongst a few of the new upgrades Another upgraded version of MKS-3 will not be out until 2022. This is due to a peace agreement for Outer Space uses between Ukraine and India. . Support from other Nations! . Russia and France are supporting ISRO in the same. The first phase was going to take place in December, 2021 but has been delayed due to the ongoing pandemic. 4 IAF pilots selected for the mission have returned after completing their training for a year in Russia. For obvious reasons, their identity however has not been revealed. They were trained at Gagarin Cosmonaut Training Centre located at Zvezda. Named after the famous Russian cosmonaut, Yuri Gagarin, the first human in outer space. (A pretty apt name for a training centre!) . . Gagarin Cosmonaut Training Centre!, 5 | . Their own personalized space suits are in the process of being built. Various space factors such as G-Force, pressure drop, hypotonia were taken into consideration while they were training. CNES is the only European contract for the project. The equipment which is prepared for the ISS, for example fireproof carry bags, will be made available to ISRO, ensuring that our astronauts, who are being referred to as Vyomanauts, receive equipment of international standards for India’s maiden space flight. . Recent Developments . In the latest news of writing this article, ISRO tested the liquid propellant Vikas engine.It is an engine used for first stage boosters. The design is based on the licensed version of the French-made Viking engine. It is a part of the family of liquid fuelled rocket engines and it uses UDMH/N204 as fuel-oxidiser as it has been the staple choice of storable liquid since the 1950s. It was developed by the USSR. ISRO faces criticism for using this ‘dirty fuel combination’ while other countries have switched to more clean fuel, like kerosene and methane. But the problem lies in thrust . If kerosene is used then another cryogenic engine will be needed. This would increase the production costs. . . Vikas Engine, 6 | . . Viking Rocket Engine, 7 | . Vikas is capable of gimbaling which basically allows rotation about a pivoted support system giving added maneuverability to the spacecraft. The recent productions have replaced the imported french components with domestic ones. The upgraded version has a chamber pressure of 58.5 bar and is capable of a massive thrust of 800KN! Enough to send our Vyomanaut into space safe and sound. . ISRO chairman, Mr. K. Sivan commented that it is too early to commit to the target.The pandemic has affected the plans for the worst, disrupting existing chains and hampering preparations and development of the flight. This has caused a lot of industries to go non-operational hence affecting the hardware supply. . Why is this a big deal! . The next frontier for showcasing a nation’s strength is Space Exploration. India needs to make its stance among the leading nations according to the ever changing geopolitical environment. Many people may argue that a nation should invest in elevating poverty, infrastructure etc. instead of investing in space exploration. But in today’s world, space exploration is a necessity. ISRO has provided tremendous contribution towards India’s drive against Covid. The information provided by satellites has helped the Indian Army in mapping out its strategies. ISRO is now collaborating with GOI to provide online visual based education to all the students of India. Space Exploration improves the overall Global collaboration and relations of India with other countries. A display of power is a necessity in order to hold a position of respect on the world stage. The most non violent form of the same is Space Exploration. Proper execution of the same will elevate the position of India in the international forum. . . Indian Space Research Organisation, 8 | . In the next few years, the dream of Vikram Sarabhai, the “the father of the Indian space programme”, the man who led the Space technology revolution in India, will turn into reality. The Tricolour waving majestically in the deep abyss called space, shall inspire a whole new generation to not look down on daily menial problems of life existing all around them, but rather look up to the sky and see an universe full of possibility. And ISRO’s Gaganyaan mission aims to do this. For India shall not stay behind in the field of space exploration. For India shall prove its worth and shine. . https://pbs.twimg.com/media &#8617; . | https://images.firstpost.com/wp-content/ &#8617; . | https://images.news18.com/ &#8617; . | https://qph.fs.quoracdn.net/ &#8617; . | https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/ &#8617; . | https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/ &#8617; . | https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/ &#8617; . | https://www.vskills.in/certification/blog/wp-content/uploads/2013/05 &#8617; . |",

            "title": "Errors and Error Correction in the Quantum World",
            "content": "To err is human. Sadly, computers do that too. Classical computers play around with a multitude of bits at any point in time. It is not hard for a noisy environment to flip random bits here and there. A single bit flip can lead to a tsunami of errors in calculations; multiple bit flips can be devastating. Fortunately, modern-day computers handle these errors quite well, and we have elegant error-correcting codes (ECCs) at hand. Redundancy is at the heart of such error-correcting codes. Let us see how: . A crude way of detecting and correcting bit-flip errors is to encode $ [0, 1] $ as $ [000, 111] $. We have created multiple copies of the same bit. Here, 3 bits constitute one logical bit or codeword. Any single bit flip can now be easily corrected by selecting the value of the majority of the bits. Let’s say our data is the binary sequence $ 0 1 0 $. It can be encoded as $ 000 111 000 $. Now, even if some random bits flip due to errors, $ 010 110 100 $, we can always correct the errors by choosing the value of the majority of the bits, taken in threes. $ 010 $ is corrected to $ 000 $, $ 110 $ to $ 111 $ and $ 100 $ to $ 000 $. Therefore, $ 010 110 100 $ is corrected to $ 000 111 000 $, which can be decoded back to $ 0 1 0 $, the original binary sequence. . The Quantum Realm . Things get pretty tricky as we enter the quantum realm. It is essential to understand what a qubit is, in order to understand quantum errors. A qubit (short for quantum-bit) is a two-level quantum system used as a basic unit of information in quantum computing. The state of a qubit is represented by vectors (or wave functions). A qubit can have states $ vert 0⟩ $ and $ vert 1⟩ $ (analogous to 0 and 1 in classical bits). The brackets around $ vert 0⟩ $ and $ vert 1⟩ $ are a fancy way of representing vectors in a notation called the Dirac notation. The symbol $ vert ψ⟩ $ is generally used to represent the state of a qubit. . Two interesting phenomena that set the qubits apart from classical bits are superposition and entanglement. Superposition allows a qubit to achieve states which are a linear combination of $ vert 0⟩ $ and $ vert 1⟩ $, i.e. $ c_1 vert 0⟩+ c_2 vert 1⟩ $ (where $ c_1, c_2 $ are complex numbers and  $ vert c_1 vert ^2+ vert c_2 vert ^2 = 1 $). A qubit can therefore choose from an infinite set of states, taking arbitrary values of $ c_1 $ and $ c_2 $. Entanglement is the name given to a strong correlation that can exist between two or more qubits. It is amusingly called “spooky action at a distance” since the correlation is independent of the separation between the qubits. Both superposition and entanglement are essential tools in many quantum algorithms. Geometrically, a qubit is neatly represented as a point on (or inside, but that’s a topic for another day) a special unit sphere known as the Bloch Sphere: . . The Bloch Sphere visualized, 1 | . The state of the qubit is re-parameterized in terms of $ θ $ and $ φ $ to fit on the Bloch Sphere.   . ∣ψ⟩=eiγ(cos⁡θ2∣0⟩+eiφsin⁡θ2∣1⟩) Large vert ψ⟩= e^{iγ} ( cos{ dfrac{θ}{2}} vert 0⟩+ e^{iφ} sin{ dfrac{θ}{2}} vert 1⟩)∣ψ⟩=eiγ(cos2θ​∣0⟩+eiφsin2θ​∣1⟩) . $ e^{iγ} $ represents the global phase factor and has no effect on the Bloch Sphere representation of the qubit. . Errors . All quantum algorithms are developed considering qubits to be perfectly isolated from the environment. However, a perfectly isolated quantum system is realistically impossible to achieve. We strive to achieve near-perfection, but the system essentially remains an open system. Open quantum systems interact with the environment and exchange energy. This interaction is the root cause of quantum errors.  The Hamiltonian of the interaction decides the type of error that occurs. A Hamiltonian is nothing but an operator that describes the energy of the quantum system. . An easy way to look at quantum errors is in the form of deformities of the Bloch Sphere. The type of deformation depends on the Hamiltonian of the interaction. Let us look at some single qubit errors: . Phase-flip error . We represented a qubit as ∣ψ⟩=eiγ(cos⁡θ2∣0⟩+eiφsin⁡θ2∣1⟩) vert ψ⟩= e^{iγ} ( cos{ dfrac{θ}{2}} vert 0⟩+ e^{iφ} sin{ dfrac{θ}{2}} vert 1⟩)∣ψ⟩=eiγ(cos2θ​∣0⟩+eiφsin2θ​∣1⟩) The term $ e^{iγ} $ is called the global phase of the qubit. A qubit is represented by the same point on the Bloch Sphere, irrespective of the global phase. However, when the qubit is in a superposition, the relative phases of different states cannot be ignored. For example,   a qubit in state $ - vert 1⟩ $ is indistinguishable from a qubit in state $ vert 1⟩ $. However, a qubit in a superposition ∣+⟩=12(∣0⟩+∣1⟩) vert +⟩ = dfrac{1}{ sqrt{2}} ( vert 0⟩ + vert 1⟩)∣+⟩=2​1​(∣0⟩+∣1⟩) is different from   ∣−⟩=12(∣0⟩−∣1⟩) vert -⟩ = dfrac{1}{ sqrt{2}} ( vert 0⟩ - vert 1⟩)∣−⟩=2​1​(∣0⟩−∣1⟩) $ vert +⟩ $ is represented along the positive $ X $ axis, whereas $ vert -⟩ $ is represented along the negative $ X $ axis. The phase-flip error is similar to applying a $ Z $ gate on the qubits. A $ Z $ gate changes a qubit state $ vert 1⟩ $ to $ - vert 1⟩ $ but it has no effect on the state $ vert 0⟩ $. Therefore, under a phase-flip error, a qubit starting in state c1∣0⟩+c2∣1⟩c_1 vert 0⟩ + c_2 vert 1⟩c1​∣0⟩+c2​∣1⟩ starts oscillating between the states c1∣0⟩+c2∣1⟩ and c1∣0⟩−c2∣1⟩c_1 vert 0⟩ + c_2 vert 1⟩ text{ and } c_1 vert 0⟩ - c_2 vert 1⟩c1​∣0⟩+c2​∣1⟩ and c1​∣0⟩−c2​∣1⟩ On an average, it can be visualized as the shrinking of the $ XY $ plane of the Bloch Sphere: . . Phase Flip Error | . Bit-flip error . A bit flip error is an error in which the state $ vert 0⟩ $ of the qubit is flipped to $ vert 1⟩ $ and vice-versa. The error can be simulated by the application of a X gate on the qubits. Thus, a qubit starting in the state c1∣0⟩+c2∣1⟩c_1 vert 0⟩ + c_2 vert 1⟩c1​∣0⟩+c2​∣1⟩ starts oscillating between the states c1∣0⟩+c2∣1⟩ and c1∣1⟩+c2∣0⟩c_1 vert 0⟩ + c_2 vert 1⟩ text{ and } c_1 vert 1⟩ + c_2 vert 0⟩c1​∣0⟩+c2​∣1⟩ and c1​∣1⟩+c2​∣0⟩ On an average, it can be visualized as the shrinking of the $ YZ $ plane of the Bloch Sphere. . Bit-phase flip error . A bit-phase flip error combines bit-flip and phase-flip errors and can be seen as applying a $ Y $ gate on the qubits. $ Y $ gate changes a qubit in state $ vert 0⟩ $ to state $ i vert 1⟩ $ and a qubit in state $ vert 1⟩ $ to state $ -i vert 0⟩$ . Thus, a qubit starting in the state c1∣0⟩+c∣1⟩c_1 vert 0⟩ + c_ vert 1⟩c1​∣0⟩+c∣​1⟩ starts oscillating between the states c1∣0⟩+c2∣1⟩ and ic1∣1⟩−ic2∣0⟩c_1 vert 0⟩ + c_2 vert 1⟩ text{ and } ic_1 vert 1⟩ - ic_2 vert 0⟩c1​∣0⟩+c2​∣1⟩ and ic1​∣1⟩−ic2​∣0⟩ On an average, it can be visualized as the shrinking of the $ XZ $ plane of the Bloch Sphere. . Depolarization . In depolarization, there is uniform shrinking of the Bloch Sphere. Eventually, the state shrinks to a point at the center of the Bloch Sphere, and all information is lost. . . Depolarization | . Spontaneous emission . The state $ vert 0⟩ $ is naturally a lower energy state than state $ vert 1⟩ $. In spontaneous emission, the qubit emits energy to the environment and slowly recedes towards the lower energy state $ vert 0⟩ $. This happens when the environment is at absolute zero, such that the qubit only emits energy to the environment and no energy is absorbed from the environment. . . Spontaneous Emission | . Spontaneous emission + thermalization . More realistically, when the environment is at temperatures above absolute zero, the qubit emits energy to the environment and also absorbs some energy from the environment. In this case, the Bloch Sphere recedes to a point P of minimum energy inside it. This is termed spontaneous emission + thermalization. . . Receeding Bloch Sphere | . Challenges in Error Correction . Continuum of errors . Intuitively, any slight nudge to the state of a qubit represented on the Bloch Sphere can be characterized as a quantum error. A correct state of a qubit has infinite possibilities to choose from in the error subspace. We have to deal with a continuum of quantum errors! . No-Cloning Theorem . Remember how we talked about redundancy being at the heart of classical error-correcting codes? Things get spicy in the quantum realm, thanks to the no-cloning theorem. The no-cloning states that it is impossible to create an independent and identical copy of an arbitrary unknown qubit state. We have to come up with ways to create redundancy without cloning the state of a qubit! . The collapse of the wavefunction . The measurement postulate of quantum mechanics states that the state of a qubit collapses upon measurement. This translates to the destruction of the qubit, and hence information, once a qubit is measured. We have to develop ways to look for errors and correct them without measuring the qubit! . Overcoming the Challenges . The proposed challenges might make it look impossible to design error-correcting codes for quantum systems. However, humans are smart. We have some neat tricks to overcome the proposed challenges. Understanding the following section requires some background knowledge about qubits, quantum gates, and quantum circuits. . Digitization of errors . An open quantum system evolves according to the following equation: . ρnew=∑(Kα ρold Kα†) Large ρ_{new} = sum (K_{ alpha} ρ_{old} K^{ dagger}_{ alpha})ρnew​=∑(Kα​ ρold​ Kα†​) . $ ρ $ is the density operator, which is an alternate way of representing the state of a qubit. $ K_{ alpha} $ is the Kraus operator that satisfies the property: ∑(Kα Kα†)=1 sum (K_{ alpha} K^{ dagger}_{ alpha}) = 1∑(Kα​ Kα†​)=1 Each state that is a part of the density operator ρ evolves as follows: ∣ψ⟩new=Kα∣ψ⟩old vert ψ⟩_{new} = K_{ alpha} vert ψ⟩_{old}∣ψ⟩new​=Kα​∣ψ⟩old​ $ K_{ alpha} $ can be represented as a $ 2 $  x $ 2 $ complex matrix. The identity matrix and the Pauli matrices : I^,σx^,σy^,σz^{ hat{I}, hat{σ_x}, hat{σ_y}, hat{σ_z}}I^,σx​^​,σy​^​,σz​^​ form the basis for $ 2 $ x $ 2 $ complex matrices over complex numbers. . . Pauli spin matrices | . The Kraus operator can be expressed in terms of the basis matrices as: . Kα=αiI^+αxσx^,+αyσy^,+αzσz^,K_{ alpha} = alpha_i hat{I} + alpha_x hat{σ_x}, + alpha_y hat{σ_y}, + alpha_z hat{σ_z},Kα​=αi​I^+αx​σx​^​,+αy​σy​^​,+αz​σz​^​, where $ alpha_i $, $ alpha_x $, $ alpha_y $ and $ alpha_z $ are arbitrary complex numbers. An interesting property of the Pauli matrices is that $ i hat{σ_x} hat{σ_z} = hat{σ_y} $. Therefore, the Kraus operator can be reformulated as Kα=αiI^+αxσx^,+αyiσx^σz^,+αzσz^K_{ alpha} = alpha_i hat{I} + alpha_x hat{σ_x}, + alpha_y i hat{σ_x} hat{σ_z}, + alpha_z hat{σ_z}Kα​=αi​I^+αx​σx​^​,+αy​iσx​^​σz​^​,+αz​σz​^​. The beauty of this reformulation is that we have mapped general noise to discrete Pauli errors using a bit of mathematics. We have to correct only Pauli X and Pauli Z errors.  We have immensely narrowed down the class of errors that we have to deal with. We no longer have to address the continuum of errors. . Entanglement for redundancy . The no-cloning prevents us from creating exact independent copies of an arbitrary unknown state, but we can create redundancies using the power of entanglement. We can easily create an entanglement using the C-NOT gates as shown: . . C-NOT gates | . Here, if $ q_0 = c_1 vert 0⟩+ c_2 vert 1⟩ $, $ q_1 = vert 0⟩ $ and $ q_2= vert 0⟩ $, the outcome of the circuit is simply $ c_1 vert 000⟩+ c_2 vert 111⟩ $. Voila! We have achieved redundancy without violating the no-cloning theorem here. Cloning a state $ c_1 vert 0⟩+ c_2 vert 1⟩ $ would mean creating three independent copies of it. What we have created is an entanglement of three qubits, due to which the three qubits are dependent on each other. However, these entangled qubits are good enough for our purpose. . Projective measurements . When a qubit $ c_1 vert 0⟩+ c_2 vert 1⟩ $ is encoded to $ c_1 vert 000⟩+ c_2 vert 111⟩ $, we have expanded the state space of qubits from a 2-dimensional state space to an 8-dimensional state space. The 8-dimensional state can be thought of to be composed of a logical qubit subspace with ${ vert 000⟩, vert 111⟩}$ as the basis and an error subspace with ${ vert 001⟩, vert 010⟩, vert 011⟩, vert 100⟩, vert 101⟩, vert 110⟩}$ as the basis. A correct qubit always resides in the logical qubit subspace.  It is only when errors occur that the qubit goes to the error subspace. For example, a correct qubit $ c_1 vert 000⟩+ c_2 vert 111⟩ $ in the logical qubit subspace may be changed to $ c_1 vert 010⟩+ c_2 vert 110⟩ $ due to errors, thereby entering the error subspace. . . Logical Qubit subspace and error subspace | . To avoid the destruction of the state of the qubits due to measurement, we make use of an extra qubit called an ancillary qubit. We measure only the ancillary qubit, leaving the other qubits undisturbed. We model the quantum circuit such that the measurements of the ancillary qubit help to detect whether our qubits are in the logical qubit subspace or the error subspace. . The Quantum Threshold Theorem . The quantum threshold theorem says that a quantum computer with a physical error rate below a certain threshold can, through application of quantum error correcting schemes, suppress the logical error rate to arbitrarily low levels. There was a time when it was considered unrealistic to create real world quantum computers due to the challenges posed by quantum errors. However, using the techniques described above as the foundation, elegant error correcting codes have been proposed to detect and correct quantum errors. Shor’s 9 qubit code is a remarkable checkpoint in quantum error correction. It uses nine qubits to encode one logical qubit and is able to correct phase-flip, bit-flip and bit-phase flip errors! Quantum error correction is an active area of research that re-establishes our faith in the creation of feasible quantum computers in the near future. . Suggested Reading .

            "title": "VENUS: The Sexiest Planet of our Solar System",
            "content": "If you have ever looked up at the night sky, you must have seen the planet. Being the third brightest object in our sky after the sun and the moon, it’s pretty hard to miss. Speaking of the moon, this planet has no natural satellite of its own. The planet got its name from the Roman goddess of love and beauty, quite apt indeed. Venus, the second closest planet to our sun in the solar system, is often referred to as Earth’s twin due to its identical shape and size. Yet, there are significant differences between the two. The most obvious one is the environment on Venus which is non-conducive for life (as far as we know it yet!). The rotational direction of Venus is opposite to all the other planets in the solar system except Uranus, which shares the common event of the sun rising in the West and setting down in the East. The length of a day on Venus is equivalent to around 117 Earth days (synodic, 243 days if you wish to count sidereal), making it the planet with the longest duration of a day. Venus is the closest a planet can get to Earth, but it doesn’t stay that way for long because of its orbit. Venus is a mere (at the cosmic scale) 40 million km away from the Earth at its closest, while the farthest it can get, on the other side of the sun, is roughly 260 million km. While the orbit of other planets is elliptical, the orbit of Venus is the closest we have to a circular one. With an eccentricity of much less than 1, it is indeed the closest in our solar system. . Chemical Buildup and Weather and Surface . . Artistic Impression of the Venusian Surface, 1 | . The atmosphere of Venus is highly dense, one of the densest the astronomers have encountered. The thickest amongst the inner rocky planets. Over 96% of it consists of only carbon dioxide, and the rest contain nitrogen and minute traces of other gases primarily. Due to the extreme density, the atmospheric pressure on the surface is 92 times the Earth’s atmospheric pressure. Unimaginably high pressure for a rather small planet. To give an idea, the same pressure on Earth would have been at around 900m below the sea surface. The best human divers with the most advanced equipment have only reached a depth of around 40m only. As if the extreme pressure weren’t enough, it is also the hottest planet. It is primarily because of its atmosphere, which, unlike Mercury (which logically should have been the hottest planet), doesn’t let the heat escape. Something similar to the greenhouse effect we have here on Earth, except it’s more intense on Venus. Because of exceptionally high concentrations of gases such as carbon dioxide, it traps heat more effectively. It prevents any heat or thermal radiation from escaping. This phenomenon is what we call a runaway greenhouse effect. The mean temperature of the planet is approximately 460 degrees Celsius. The temperature is high enough to melt various metals, such as lead, tin, zinc and a variety of aluminium alloys; The Venusian atmosphere has an opaque layer of sulphuric clouds. This layer is quite crucial to understanding why Venus is the way it is. These clouds are highly reflective and help trap heat. The Earth’s axis has a tilt of 23.5 degrees. This tilt is what causes the seasons on Earth. The axis of Venus is around 3 degrees only, eliminating any possibility of changing seasons and consequently eliminating any factors to mediate the extreme climate of the planet. Moreover, a particular side of Venus continually receives sunlight for roughly 58 days straight. The climate on the planet overall is one of the harshest in the solar system. The surface is regarded as isothermal, meaning the same temperature everywhere. No noticeable change in temperature can be observed on the surface as we move. The only way to cool yourself, if you somehow happen to find yourself on the surface, and if not already crushed by the atmosphere, would be to move up as high as possible. Altitude has a direct effect on temperature. The higher we rise, the cooler it gets, though still not nearly cool enough by human standards. Wind systems on the planet distribute heat throughout the surface. Thus no difference can be observed in the two hemispheres and between pole and equator. Various missions to Venus have used surface radar mapping. It has mainly been determined that the surface is riddled with craters, mountains, active volcanoes, and lava flow plains. The volcanoes are believed to be active. All the rocky planets in the solar system are riddled with craters, our Earth included. A general trend has been observed in these craters. Smaller meteorites are much more likely to strike a planet than larger ones. As a direct consequence, the number of smaller craters is greater than the larger ones. Venus has a uniquely observed trend, though. No crater smaller than about 1.5 km has been observed on the Venusian surface—a rather peculiar thing to note. . Possibility of Life . One distinct thing that astronomers always note is the striking similarity between Venus and Earth. “The Twin Sisters’’ they are called and quite rightly so. The internal structure, density, shape, and size are all very similar to our home planet. Both planets boast of a complex weather system. They are believed to have a common point of origin back in the past, around 4.5 billion years ago. Yet, the two planets diverged and developed differently enough for one planet to support life at a certain point in time. At the same time, the other was a literal microwave. Our Earth’s outer core is essentially liquid metal rotating in the direction opposite to Earth’s rotation, creating a dynamo effect that gives Earth its distinct magnetosphere. With Venus, this is not the case. It lacks its own “active” magnetic field and instead has an induced one, which is quite interesting. Almost like a coil of wire in an electromagnet would induce a magnetic field in the iron core. Like Earth, the upper atmosphere, with no existing magnetic shielding, interacts with incoming solar radiation and gets ionized to form an ionosphere. The same happens on Earth, though on a much lesser scale. This ionosphere then can partially deflect the radiation. The Earth’s and Venus’s magnetosphere are different in shape, as shown by the figure below. . . Magnetospheres of the Respective Planets, 2 | . It is possible Venus had water in the past. But if it did have any, the high temperature would have vapourised it all. A widely accepted theory also states that solar radiation might have photodissociation in the water due to the lack of planetary magnetic field. The hydrogen gas so formed would have been carried into space via these radiations. It is crucial to mention that to date, astrobiologists have found no proof of life. The current environment is quite extreme for any life to survive. While the water might have been present in the past, nothing yet indicates life thriving on the planet in the past. If it is assumed the water was present on Venus in the past, it would have been during the period shortly after the Late Heavy Bombardment, corresponding to the Neohadean and Eoarchean eras of Earth. All these, however, are speculations, or a better way to put it would be our best guess based on the limited information available on the planet. This data has been primarily collected via radar mapping of the Venusian surface. Very little information is known about the surface because landers cannot survive the extreme heat and pressure to collect vital data and send it back. The USSR’s Venera missions are the most prominent surface missions. Venera 7 was the first to land, followed by a host of other Venera and the Vegas missions. Of the 30 successful missions launched by us involving Venus, only 8 of them had landers that were launched towards the surface. . . First pictures of Venetian Surface from Venera 13, 3 | . The longest a lander has lasted on the Venusian surface is about two hours—far less time to transmit vital information about the planet. Sending a lander to the surface is expensive and troublesome. Most prefer the easier and more logically way of studying the planet – Artificial satellites orbiting the planet, far beyond the reach of its destructive environment. Yet, much more information lies on the surface, waiting to be studied, to be explored. Perhaps it would be considered a pinnacle of human ingenuity and marvel of engineering to be able to put a stable lander on the planet – fighting against all odds for its survival, and at the same time studying the very planet which is trying so hard to destroy it. Perhaps with enough perseverance, one might also put humans on Venus. Or, for that matter of fact, anywhere in the known universe. All it takes is a determined person curious enough to explore the known boundaries of the universe. Sure there will be setbacks, failures, disappointment. Spirits may break, but as long the faith in our ability remains, we will succeed someday or the other. We have come this far, and we would continue to venture further, both into the future and space. . Spock would have been proud. . So long, and thanks for all the fish! .

            "content": "What we already know: . In our high school, we were all taught about Ernest Rutherford, J.J Thompson, and James Chadwick, who discovered the proton, electron and neutron, respectively. Ernest Rutherford was further able to predict the structure of the atom. These were significant discoveries as they were a step up from the previously existing theoretical description of atoms. Protons, electrons, and neutrons were described as fundamental particles making up everything that the universe contains. . . YOU KNOW THIS ALREADY, DON’T YOU??!, 1 | . The Essence of being Fundamental : . When we say that these particles, proton, neutron and electron, are fundamental, a question that pops up in mind is, “What does it mean to be truly fundamental in nature?” We can also extend the question to ask if these particles satisfy our criteria for being fundamental or if our physicist heroes were a little too cavalier to notice? Well, success is a lousy teacher. It seduces smart people into thinking they can’t be wrong. Let’s forget that we know anything and verify the facts from the basics. We know that protons and neutrons are of similar mass, and electrons have considerably lower mass than protons and neutrons. The proton has a +ve charge, the electron has a -ve charge, and the neutron is neutral. We also know that altering the arrangement of protons, electrons, and neutrons in a substance changes its identity. This is a rather compelling argument to conclusively say that protons, electrons, and neutrons are indeed the fundamental particles. Our mathematics imposes no limits to how much a quantity can be divided. Strictly speaking, a continuous body can be split into halves an infinite number of times. Back when Greek philosophy was at its peak and involved questioning the very nature of things, a famous Greek philosopher, Democritus, put forward a philosophical idea called the atomic hypothesis, the first recorded theory about what constituted things. Democritus hypothesized an iron block, broke it into many smaller pieces, and claimed the point where he cannot break the block any further is where he has reached the atom. Mathematics doesn’t have any boundaries, but physics has an essence of realism and imposes constraints. For many decades physicists believed that protons, neutrons and electrons were that physical boundary they were chasing until Murray Gell-Mann and George Zweig proposed that something deeper lay inside these atoms in 1964. Although Murray and George had to bombard heavy particles at a very high speed to prove the existence of particles even more elementary than the ones at hand, we will use a simple observation to further our discussion. We previously discussed how electrons have very little mass than protons and neutrons, even though the charge on them is numerically equal. What makes protons and neutrons have considerably higher mass than an electron? Sometimes in physics, asking the right question is more important than the correct answer. I would like to break the ice and directly answer the question I posed above. Protons and neutrons fail to make the cut for being fundamental particles. They are further composed of quarks and gluons. Electrons, however, are fundamental particles, a kind called leptons. This leads us to one of the most successful theories put up by humanity describing our fundamental particles - the Standard Model. . The Standard Model : . The Standard Model can be thought of as a periodic table for the elementary particles in particle physics. The elementary particles can be divided into two main categories - fermions (further subdivided into quarks and leptons) and bosons (subdivided into scalar and vector bosons). Fermions make up most of the matter in the universe as they are the building blocks of protons. Bosons are force carriers; they are the reason particles interact with each other. . . CURRENT PICTURE OF STANDARD MODEL, 2 | . The True Description of an Atom: . Now that we know what the elementary particles are, we can show how they make up our atomic structure. Recapitulating, an atom is made of protons and neutrons, which make up the nucleus present at the center of the atom while electrons revolve around the nucleus. The proton and neutron are composite elementary particles, i.e., they are made up of combinations of elementary particles. The proton comprises of two up quarks and one down quark bounded by gluons, while the neutron is made of two down quarks and one up quark bounded by gluons. Electrons, as we saw before, are one of the elementary particles. Each up quark has a charge of +⅔ e, while each down quark has a charge of -⅓ e. The sum of the charges of quarks that make up a nuclear particle determines its electrical charge. Protons thus have a total charge of +1, and neutrons have zero. Leptons carry a charge of +1 e, 0 e or -1 e. Electrons are types of leptons that have a -1e charge. . . PROTON(left) NEUTRON(right), 2 | . The Universal Blueprint of Matter: . The Standard Model is of great significance in physics because it can literally describe what everything in this universe is made up of and describe three of the four known forces in the universe, i.e., the electromagnetic force and the strong and weak forces. Electromagnetism is carried by photons and involves the interaction of electric fields and magnetic fields. The strong force, which is carried by gluons, binds together atomic nuclei to make them stable. The weak force, carried by W and Z bosons, causes nuclear reactions that have powered our Sun and other stars for billions of years. The Standard Model has the capability to answer one of the most central questions in physics, something which Albert Einstein himself died pondering, i.e. The Theory of Everything. This table encapsulates everything material in this world and how that material interacts with other matter. . . CERN is situated in Geneva, Switzerland. Place where new particles are bombarded at high speeds to discover new ones, 3 | . The Limitations: . The standard model seeks to serve as the blueprint for all existing matter and the various fundamental forces they interact with. However, there are two hurdles that need to be crossed before the model can truly become universal. All the fundamental forces of nature have been described via the model, except the most familiar one - the force of gravity. Just like the electromagnetic field has photons as its force carriers, gravitons have been hypothesized to exist for gravitational fields. Gravitons mediate gravity’s force but are not proven because of a mathematical problem in general relativity. Apart from the existing headache of integrating gravitons into our existing model and giving way to quantum gravity, other challenges still remain. There are still a lot of fundamental particles yet to be discovered. Given that the most recent addition to our model was as recent as 2012 (the famous Higgs-Boson particle was discovered), researchers are always looking for new particles. They keep smashing high-speed particles in the hope of getting some insight into this blueprint of the universe. However, if we assume gravitons to be true, a lot of physics problems could be solved, one of them being Quantum Gravity, which would be a big milestone in science. Many physicists believe that our understanding of Mathematics and Physics is not yet good enough to prove the existence of Gravitons, putting it into simpler terms. Humans are too dumb to solve this problem, or perhaps… there is someone among the readers who might not be! The other problem is that while these particles account for the visible Universe, there is a large amount of mass and energy in the Universe that visible matter simply can not explain. This has been dubbed “dark matter” and “dark energy” and none of our theories come close to explaining them. But this is a story for another time. . Der anfang ist die ende und der ende ist der anfang : . In our pursuit of understanding the universe, the standard model is a huge step. The model unravels the mystery of the universe far beyond the comprehension of a layman. Particle physics is notorious for being highly mathematically rigorous. Still, in this article, I have tried to build from basic knowledge of atoms so that the same layman could appreciate the beauty of this subject the same way I do. The beauty of physics lies not in finding answers but in asking questions. Previously we mentioned Democritus breaking matter into infinitesimally small parts. Here is a question I would like you to ponder upon: can you break even the elementary particles that we have introduced to you? Enter STRING THEORY!! .

If you were there you wouldn’t fit. If you did fit, you wouldn’t be able to see. Assuming none of the other myriad problems are our concern. After all, we neglect air resistance and higher-order terms. Soon, you have enough room growing around you, the region clears up and stuff gets moving around you.

Quantities which demand such extravagant errors are extravagant themselves. With our logarithmic minds already having lost track of these scales, what are three more zeros at the end?

A drop of ink in the vast ocean. Without having survival to worry about unlike other creatures, we sat down to think. And think we did. We had eccentric Greek graybeards, who could only do so much despite being ahead of their time. Hidden away within their separate geographical barriers lay the diligent Chinese and the intelligent Indians who shed light, the value of which would take a very long time to be realized. However, the moment where we started to catch fire was much later. The self-proclaimed center of our world, the most powerful conquerors were in a transition. Here, they gave birth to the scientific method and hence the scientific revolution. We had begun. . A flurry of discoveries and developments well documented by many others across the world leaves little that remains to be said. The spark from the flint had become a wildfire and the hunger fueled by our megalomania gave us things we would never have imagined when we evolved into being. Lord Kelvin once said that physics was done for. Everything we’d ever hoped to discover or find was found, we’d only have to measure things more precisely for the sake of it. He couldn’t be further from the truth. With Max Planck playing spoilsport and opening up a whole new world, it turns out that we have much left to find. . . A timeline we don’t want to be in | . Chances are you’ve heard of the many-worlds interpretation of quantum mechanics and alternate timelines. We accommodate a different universe where any other course of action which could have taken place takes place. Think of a different course of action for everything you’ve done today. What if you stretch it out to your life? What about the lives of others? What if we didn’t exist? Well, we’re stuck in this Universe where we don’t have a choice :P It is remarkable that despite the overwhelming number of possible universes we could be in, we have ended up in this one. We are, indeed, very lucky. . The advent of computers has accelerated everything. The white horse we were riding on has become a tidal wave. Physics has been revolutionized by the data wave. Massive amounts of observational data are changing the way we formulate theories. The image of the black hole taken by the EHT had PETABYTES of data, all for one lovely image. Seriously, I can see stuff around me better without my spectacles. We are but a feather in this data storm. To understand the large, we’d have to understand the small. We’d also want to mess around with simulations of quantum activity, to speed up the very thing we’re using to simulate our stuff right now. A positive feedback loop! . . M87*, the first image of a black hole taken by the EHT Collaboration, 1 | . In this rapidly changing world, we are stuck in a relentless rat race where everyone refuses to yield. The past keeps haunting the future, and all we ever want is a little peace and quiet. In this fast lane, our vision is tunneled. A young man went to the wise vizier for advice. The vizier gave him a spoon with some oil and told him to walk around the palace and get back to him without dropping the oil. Our focus narrows to the drops of oil on our spoon, we refuse to look at the gardens, the pillars and the architecture.

We sit in the cockpit to decide which of the many worlds we want to enter now and we hope you will join us on our roller coaster.
