# BITS Phy Assoc Blog

_powered by [fastpages](https://github.com/fastai/fastpages)_

We may have support for Word and Jupyter, in addition to markdown, but we prefer to stick to only markdown for standard articles. For general markdown syntax, you can refer to this [cheat sheet](markdownguide.org/cheat-sheet/). There are numerous other resources to learn markdown which you can make use of. Markdown is a superset of standard HTML syntax which means you can use HTML tags within your articles as well. After you've got this down, you can begin transfering your article into markdown. Every markdown file which is an article must have the following header:

```
---
title: "With the title duh"
description: "A short description (20 words max)"
author: "Multiple authors", "Can be added like this"
layout: post            # Remove text beyond the #
toc: false              # If you want a table of contents based on markdown headers
comments: true          # If you want to enable/disable comments on the post
image:                  # Provide a permalink to an image which will be the cover of the article
hide: false             # Don't change
search_exclude: false   # Don't change
categories: ["Add", "Multiple", "Tags"]
---
```

Within the article you can have text and even LaTeX for math (for God's sake don't put a png of math). Refer to the cheat sheet if you want additional formatting like tables and emphasis. For images, please use the format as described here:

```
|![Alt Text](Permalink to image) | 
|:--:| 
| *Caption, [^n]* |
```

followed by 

```
[^n]: in the bottom as footnotes with credits for the photo
```

In case you want to use your own image for the article rather than using one from the web (because you made it yourself/cropped/edited it), upload it into the `/images/blog/{article number}-{first word of title}/` directory. This will let you access the image from the permalink "[https://raw.githubusercontent.com/bitsphyassoc/blog/master/images/blog/{article number}-{first word of title}/{image file}](https://github.com/bitsphyassoc/blog)". Finally, save the file in the format `YYYY-MM-DD-*.md`, with each word in the title being hyphen-separated. When you're done with all of this, you can push the article for publication.

P. S. If you have math in your article, make sure it doesn't conflict with markdown. The way in which markdown works forces an equation to flow with the paragraph unless its surrounded by a pair of line breaks as well. These equations would also need a `\Large` or a `\large` right after opening the LaTeX environment so that it appears uniformly with the rest of the text. If you find any other peculiar behavior, please open an issue, we will try to fill it in with a fix and update the advisory in this readme.
