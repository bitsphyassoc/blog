## What's the Craze all About?!
Space, the final frontier! The ultimate playground for human curiosity and ingenuity. USA and Russia have etched their names in this quest of helping mankind reach space, and all the credit goes to their amazingly redundant and ingenious space flight programmes.These two countries are the 2 out of the only 3 nations that have successfully launched manned missions into space. We have the “Cold War '' to thank for, for it was the reason why these two countries were    able to achieve what they did. A period of great rivalry between them, this also   extended to space missions, leading to what is now known as the “Space Race”.

## India joins the race!
The Space Race was an integral part of the Cold War, which was ended by the USA after launching its  legendary Apollo missions. India is all set to become the 4th nation with its very own manned space mission, Gaganyaan. 

Prime minister Narendra Modi announced it from atop the  Red Fort in 2018 on our Independence day. A perfect day to announce the mission which, if successful, would make India truly independent and a dominant force in the global space community. This project is planned to take place in broadly 3 stages, 2 unmanned and 1 manned. A 3 person crew in a low Earth orbit by indeginous GSLV Mk-III.

## GSLV MK-III?? sounds like a new Iron Man suit!!!
GSLV MK_III, weighing a massive 55 tons,built initially  to launch communication satellites into geostationary orbit, went on to become the very launcher to be used for Chandrayan - 2, ISRO’s heaviest spacecraft. Certain upgrades are planned for increasing its efficiency. The geometry of the propellant inside the rocket constitutes a very important part of its performance. When the fuel  burns, its shape changes, and this is truly remarkable.. Recently the propellant grain geometry of the head end segment was changed from a 10 star slotted lobbed configuration to 13 starred configuration. 

The planned changes include replacing the original L110 core stage, powered by twin engine configuration, with kerolox. Kerolox is a binary rocket fuel composed of liquid oxygen and kerosene.The fuel volume judges the capabilities of the rocket . After various research work and carefully testing various fuels to optimise thrust- weight (of fuel) ratio, kerolox has proved to be much better propollent than the traditionally used hydrolox. 

It will be  powered by an  indegenous liquid fuel rocket engine, SCE-200, which is still in development. This engine is also expected to power up the upcoming ISRO projects: Unified Launch Vehicle and Reusable Launch Vehicle.

This will increase its payload to 6 metric tonnes (A huge difference!). An increase in the propellant load on hydrolox stage and a new cryogenic tank (a tank used to store liquid at very low temperatures), C32-LH2, made by Hindustan Aeronautics Limited are amongst a few of the new upgrades Another upgraded version of MKS-3 will not be out until 2022. This is due to a peace agreement for Outer Space uses between Ukraine and India.

## Support from other Nations!
Russia and France are supporting ISRO in the same. The first phase was going to take place in December, 2021 but has been delayed due to the ongoing pandemic. 4 IAF pilots selected for the mission have returned after completing their training for a year in Russia. For obvious reasons, their identity however has not been revealed. They were trained at Gagarin Cosmonaut Training Centre located at Zvezda. Named after the famous Russian cosmonaut, Yuri Gagarin, the first human in outer space. (A pretty apt name for a training centre!)

Their own personalized space suits are in the process of being built. Various space factors such as G-Force, pressure drop, hypotonia were taken into consideration while they were training. CNES is the only European contract for the project. The equipment which is prepared for the ISS, for example fireproof carry bags,  will be made available to ISRO, ensuring that our astronauts, who are being referred to as Vyomanauts, receive equipment of international standards for India’s maiden space flight. 

## Recent Developments
In the latest news of writing this article, ISRO tested the liquid propellant Vikas engine.It is an engine used for first stage boosters. The design is based on the licensed version of the French-made Viking engine. It is a part of the family of liquid fuelled rocket engines and it uses UDMH/N204 as fuel-oxidiser as it has been the staple choice of storable liquid since the 1950s. It was developed by the USSR. ISRO faces criticism for using this ‘dirty fuel combination’ while other countries have switched to more clean fuel, like kerosene and methane. But the problem lies in thrust . If kerosene is used then another cryogenic engine will be needed. This would increase the production costs.

Vikas is capable of gimbaling which basically allows rotation about a pivoted support system giving added maneuverability to the spacecraft. The recent productions have replaced the imported french components with domestic ones. The upgraded version has a chamber pressure of 58.5 bar and is capable of a massive thrust of 800KN! Enough to send our Vyomanaut into space safe and sound.

ISRO chairman, Mr. K. Sivan commented that it is too early to commit to the target.The pandemic has affected the plans for the worst, disrupting existing chains and hampering preparations and development of the flight. This has caused a lot of industries to go non-operational hence affecting the hardware supply.

## Why is this a big deal!
The next frontier for showcasing a nation’s strength is Space Exploration. India needs to make its stance among the leading nations according to the ever changing geopolitical environment. Many people may argue that a nation should invest in elevating poverty, infrastructure etc. instead of investing in space exploration. But in today’s world, space exploration is a necessity. ISRO has provided tremendous contribution towards India’s drive against Covid. The information provided by satellites has helped the Indian Army in mapping out its strategies. ISRO is now collaborating with GOI to provide online visual based education to all the students of India. Space Exploration improves the overall Global collaboration and relations of India with other countries. A display of power is a necessity in order to hold a position of respect  on the world stage. The most non violent form of the same is Space Exploration. Proper execution of the same will elevate the position of India in the international forum.

In the next few years, the dream of Vikram Sarabhai, the  “the father of the Indian space programme”, the man who led the Space technology revolution in India, will turn into reality. The Tricolour waving majestically in the deep abyss called space, shall inspire a whole new generation to not look down on daily menial problems of life existing all around them, but rather look up to the sky and see an universe full of possibility. And ISRO’s Gaganyaan mission aims to do this. For India shall not stay behind in the field of space exploration. For India shall prove its worth and shine.
