A lacuna, an oblivion of nothingness like no other. Or so we think, for nothing is certain about this place. If we can call it a place. If we can go back to before it happened. But how do you define time here? And then it happens. A blink is too long of an interval to describe it. Before you know it, there’s everything. If you were there you wouldn’t fit. If you did fit, you wouldn’t be able to see. Assuming none of the other myriad problems are our concern. After all, we neglect air resistance and higher-order terms. Soon, you have enough room growing around you, the region clears up and stuff gets moving around you. You have space to move about and so does light, meaning you can finally see. Before you know it, all the good stuff is over. The only major artifact of this fantastic event is a tiny whine which was mistaken for pigeon droppings.</summary><media:thumbnail xmlns:media="http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/" url="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/bitsphyassoc/blog/master/images/blog/1-remarkable/image5.png" /><media:content medium="image" url="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/bitsphyassoc/blog/master/images/blog/1-remarkable/image5.png" xmlns:media="http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/" /></entry></feed>
