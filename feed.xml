Space, the final frontier! The ultimate playground for human curiosity and ingenuity. USA and Russia have etched their names in this quest of helping mankind reach space, and all the credit goes to their amazingly redundant and ingenious space flight programmes.These two countries are the 2 out of the only 3 nations that have successfully launched manned missions into space. We have the “Cold War ‘’ to thank for, for it was the reason why these two countries were able to achieve what they did. A period of great rivalry between them, this also extended to space missions, leading to what is now known as the “Space Race”.</summary><media:thumbnail xmlns:media="http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/" url="https://resize.indiatvnews.com/en/resize/newbucket/1200_-/2021/06/gaganyaan-1624867825.jpg" /><media:content medium="image" url="https://resize.indiatvnews.com/en/resize/newbucket/1200_-/2021/06/gaganyaan-1624867825.jpg" xmlns:media="http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/" /></entry><entry><title type="html">Errors and Error Correction in the Quantum World</title><link href="https://bitsphyassoc.github.io/blog/quantum%20computation/errors/bloch%20sphere/2021/11/04/quantum-error.html" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Errors and Error Correction in the Quantum World" /><published>2021-11-04T00:00:00-05:00</published><updated>2021-11-04T00:00:00-05:00</updated><id>https://bitsphyassoc.github.io/blog/quantum%20computation/errors/bloch%20sphere/2021/11/04/quantum-error</id><author><name>Uday Singla</name></author><category term="Quantum Computation" /><category term="Errors" /><category term="Bloch Sphere" /><summary type="html">To err is human. Sadly, computers do that too. Classical computers play around with a multitude of bits at any point in time. It is not hard for a noisy environment to flip random bits here and there. A single bit flip can lead to a tsunami of errors in calculations; multiple bit flips can be devastating. Fortunately, modern-day computers handle these errors quite well, and we have elegant error-correcting codes (ECCs) at hand. Redundancy is at the heart of such error-correcting codes.

Being the third brightest object in our sky after the sun and the moon, it’s pretty hard to miss. Speaking of the moon, this planet has no natural satellite of its own. The planet got its name from the Roman goddess of love and beauty, quite apt indeed. Venus, the second closest planet to our sun in the solar system, is often referred to as Earth’s twin due to its identical shape and size. Yet, there are significant differences between the two. The most obvious one is the environment on Venus which is non-conducive for life (as far as we know it yet!). The rotational direction of Venus is opposite to all the other planets in the solar system except Uranus, which shares the common event of the sun rising in the West and setting down in the East. The length of a day on Venus is equivalent to around 117 Earth days (synodic, 243 days if you wish to count sidereal), making it the planet with the longest duration of a day. Venus is the closest a planet can get to Earth, but it doesn’t stay that way for long because of its orbit. Venus is a mere (at the cosmic scale) 40 million km away from the Earth at its closest, while the farthest it can get, on the other side of the sun, is roughly 260 million km. While the orbit of other planets is elliptical, the orbit of Venus is the closest we have to a circular one. With an eccentricity of much less than 1, it is indeed the closest in our solar system.</summary><media:thumbnail xmlns:media="http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/" url="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/bitsphyassoc/blog/master/images/blog/2-venus/cover.jpg" /><media:content medium="image" url="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/bitsphyassoc/blog/master/images/blog/2-venus/cover.jpg" xmlns:media="http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/" /></entry><entry><title type="html">A Primer to the Standard Model</title><link href="https://bitsphyassoc.github.io/blog/particle%20physics/standard%20model/elementary%20particles/universe/2021/09/16/standard-model.html" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="A Primer to the Standard Model" /><published>2021-09-16T00:00:00-05:00</published><updated>2021-09-16T00:00:00-05:00</updated><id>https://bitsphyassoc.github.io/blog/particle%20physics/standard%20model/elementary%20particles/universe/2021/09/16/standard-model</id><author><name>Abhinav Choudhary</name></author><category term="Particle Physics" /><category term="Standard Model" /><category term="Elementary Particles" /><category term="Universe" /><summary type="html">What we already know: In our high school, we were all taught about Ernest Rutherford, J.J Thompson, and James Chadwick, who discovered the proton, electron and neutron, respectively. Ernest Rutherford was further able to predict the structure of the atom. These were significant discoveries as they were a step up from the previously existing theoretical description of atoms. Protons, electrons, and neutrons were described as fundamental particles making up everything that the universe contains.</summary><media:thumbnail xmlns:media="http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/" url="https://physicsworld.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Martina-Hestericova-3-April-Quantum-computing-for-high-energy-physics_authorized.jpg" /><media:content medium="image" url="https://physicsworld.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Martina-Hestericova-3-April-Quantum-computing-for-high-energy-physics_authorized.jpg" xmlns:media="http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/" /></entry></feed>
